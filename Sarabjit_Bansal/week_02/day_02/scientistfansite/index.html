      <p>Sophie Wilson is a British computer scientist and software engineer. Wilson designed the Acorn Micro-Computer, the first of a long line of computers sold by Acorn Computers Ltd, including its programming language BBC BASIC. Wilson later designed the instruction set of the ARM processor, which became the de facto model used in 21st-century smartphones..</p>



      <p class="full">Wilson was a member of the board of the technology and games company Eidos plc and was a consultant to ARM Ltd when it was split off from Acorn in 1990.Sophie now works as Chief Architect at Broadcom in Cambridge.</p>

         <p class="Process"> Wilson also diversified into image processing with the image processing application, ChangeFSI and this led to another project, Acorn Replay, which amazed both Acorn users and RISC OS licensees by allowing full-speed playback of AVI and MPEG video, on hardware as slow as a 25MHz ARM3 processor with no floating-point hardware.</p>
