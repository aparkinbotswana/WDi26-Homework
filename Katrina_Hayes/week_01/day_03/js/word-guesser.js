// You'll create a simple word guessing game where the user gets infinite tries to guess the word (like Hangman without the hangman, or like Wheel of Fortune without the wheel and fortune).
//
// Create two global arrays: one to hold the letters of the word (e.g. 'F', 'O', 'X'), and one to hold the current guessed letters (e.g. it would start with '_', '_', '_' and end with 'F', 'O', 'X').
// Write a function called guessLetter that will:
// Take one argument, the guessed letter.
// Iterate through the word letters and see if the guessed letter is in there.
// If the guessed letter matches a word letter, changed the guessed letters array to reflect that.
// When it's done iterating, it should log the current guessed letters ('F__') and congratulate the user if they found a new letter.
// It should also figure out if there are any more letters that need to be guessed, and if not, it should congratulate the user for winning the game.
// Pretend you don't know the word, and call guessLetter multiple times with various letters to check that your program works.
